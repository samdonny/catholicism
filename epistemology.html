    <h1>Epistemology: Scripture, Tradition &amp; Authority</h1>

    <h2>Introductory Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Epistemology asks how we come to know divine truth and which authorities
      can bind our conscience.  In the sixteenth century the Reformers argued
      that the Bible alone is the ultimate source of Christian doctrine (known
      as <em>sola scriptura</em>), whereas Catholicism teaches that divine
      revelation comes to us through both Sacred Scripture and Sacred
      Tradition, authoritatively interpreted by the living Magisterium of the
      Church.  This foundational difference underlies many other doctrinal
      disputes.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Topic Is</h2>
    <p>
      Theological epistemology deals with the sources of revelation and the
      criterion for judging doctrinal truth.  Protestants maintain that
      everything necessary for salvation is contained in the canonical
      Scriptures and that nothing is to be added by new revelation or
      tradition; the Westminster Confession teaches that the authority of
      Scripture “dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church,
      but wholly upon God” and that the whole counsel of God concerning
      salvation “is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and
      necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which
      nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the
      Spirit, or traditions of men.”<sup id="fn1-return"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>  Catholics,
      by contrast, hold that Christ entrusted both the written word and the
      oral apostolic tradition to the Church and that these form one
      inseparable deposit of faith; Vatican II teaches that Sacred Tradition
      and Sacred Scripture are “bound closely together, and communicate one
      with the other” and that the task of giving an authentic
      interpretation of the Word of God “has been entrusted to the living
      teaching office of the Church.”<sup id="fn3-return"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      How we answer the question of authority influences every other
      theological dispute.  If Scripture alone is the supreme and
      sufficient rule of faith, then doctrines or practices not found
      explicitly in Scripture are at best of secondary importance.  If,
      however, Scripture and Tradition together form a single deposit of
      revelation under the guardianship of the Magisterium, then
      extra‑biblical teachings like the canon of Scripture, the Trinity and
      infant baptism stand on the same authoritative footing as biblical
      passages.  A Catholic and a Protestant can both appeal to the Bible,
      but they will read it within different frameworks of authority.
    </p>

    <h2>Doctrinal Summary</h2>
    <h3>Protestant Position</h3>
    <p>
      The classical Reformed statement of <em>sola scriptura</em> appears in
      the Westminster Confession.  It insists that the authority of Holy
      Scripture is derived solely from God and that the entire counsel of
      God necessary for salvation is contained in Scripture alone.  It
      explicitly rejects any addition to Scripture by new revelations or
      human traditions and declares that “the supreme judge, by which all
      controversies of religion are to be determined…can be no other but
      the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.”<sup id="fn2-return"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>
      For Protestants, creeds and councils have ministerial authority only
      insofar as they repeat biblical teaching.
    </p>
    <h3>Catholic Position</h3>
    <p>
      Catholicism teaches that God’s Word comes to us through both
      Scripture and Tradition, transmitted from the apostles to the Church.
      Vatican II’s constitution <em>Dei Verbum</em> states that these two
      sources “make up a single sacred deposit of the word of God” and
      cannot be separated; the Magisterium (the pope and bishops in
      communion with him) serves as the “authentic interpreter” of that
      deposit.<sup id="fn3-return-2"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>  The Council of Trent warned
      against personal interpretation of Scripture contrary to the “sense
      held by Holy Mother Church” and required ecclesial approval for
      publishing translations or commentaries.<sup id="fn4-return"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>The Protestant Argument</h2>
    <p>
      Protestants argue that Scripture alone is uniquely inspired and
      therefore uniquely infallible.  Because all humans are fallible, any
      allegedly unwritten tradition is subject to error; consequently,
      doctrines must be proved from the Bible alone.  They observe that
      Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for elevating human traditions above
      God’s commandments and that even Church councils have contradicted
      one another.  The Westminster divines therefore made Scripture the
      sole <em>norma normans</em> (norming norm) and located the Church’s
      authority in its faithful proclamation of Scripture.  On this view:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bible alone is God‑breathed and thus the final court of appeal;</li>
      <li>The Church’s authority is ministerial and declarative, not
      magisterial;</li>
      <li>Traditions may be useful but must be tested against Scripture;</li>
      <li>The Holy Spirit speaks through Scripture to judge doctrinal
      controversies.<sup id="fn2-return-2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any doctrine that cannot be shown from Scripture (explicitly or by
      good and necessary consequence) is therefore considered non‑binding.
    </p>

    <h2>The Catholic Argument</h2>
    <p>
      Catholics contend that the Bible arose within the Church and that the
      same authority which identified the canon continues to safeguard its
      correct interpretation.  The New Testament never instructs Christians
      to operate by Scripture alone; rather, St Paul commands believers to
      “stand firm and hold to the traditions” they were taught orally or by
      letter (2 Th 2:15).  Early Christian writers consistently appealed to
      apostolic tradition to refute heresies.  Tertullian formulated a rule
      of faith: because Christ sent the apostles to teach, no one should be
      received as a preacher unless he can trace his message to them; true
      doctrine is recognised by agreement with the apostolic churches, “the
      moulds and original sources of the faith,” and all doctrines
      contrary to that apostolic tradition must be rejected.<sup id="fn5-return"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>
      Irenaeus likewise argued that one can trace the succession of
      bishops back to the apostles and that the Church at Rome holds a
      pre‑eminent authority with which all churches must agree.<sup id="fn6-return"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vatican II therefore teaches that Scripture, Tradition and the
      Magisterium are “so linked and joined together that one cannot stand
      without the others.”<sup id="fn3-return-3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>  Without an
      authoritative interpreter, Catholics argue, the text of Scripture is
      susceptible to private interpretations, leading to the doctrinal
      fragmentation seen in Protestantism.  The Church’s teaching office
      exists not to add to God’s revelation but to safeguard it and to
      transmit it faithfully through the centuries.  This harmonises with
      the practice of the early Church and provides a stable basis for
      doctrinal development.
