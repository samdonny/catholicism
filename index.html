    <h1>Exploring Why Catholicism Is True</h1>
    <p>
      This site is an educational hub designed to help you explore the most
      fundamental theological differences between Catholicism and Protestant
      Christianity.  Each doctrinal topic has its own page with a concise
      summary of what the issue is, why it matters, a doctrinal survey from both
      sides, strong arguments for the Protestant position, and a robust Catholic
      response rooted in Scripture, the early Church, and the teaching
      authority (Magisterium) of the Church.  You will also find recommended
      articles, videos and primary sources for further study.

    <p>
      Catholics and Protestants share a love for Jesus Christ and the
      Scriptures, but they diverge on how divine revelation is received and
      interpreted, how salvation works, how many sacraments Christ instituted,
      what the Church is, and who has authority to settle doctrinal questions.
      Our goal is to explore these questions charitably and in depth.
